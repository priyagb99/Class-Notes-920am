# Heads up!

This is my repo with code that I run during the class. 
- **I'm only sharing it so that you can grab some code from during the lectures if we went a little too fast for you to write things down.**
- This repo will be sloppy. It's not production quality and lecture notes won't be filled out with everything I cover verbally or on paper. 
- This repo is PURELY here so you can grab code snippets you couldn't fully type out.
